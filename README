Intercom implements a Java server and client for the WebSocket Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP).
WAMP is specified at http://wamp.ws.

Intercom implements all WAMP functionality as specified. WAMP handlers on the Server can be easily
specified via Java annotations. The Intercom library extends the WAMP specification by supporting
wildcards and a full support of URI's.

Detailed documentation can be produced via JavaDoc.

Intercom can be compiled using ant and the provided build.xml file. The build.properties file
may need to be updated with dependency paths. By default all dependencies are assumed to be in
the lib directory which is not included in the release.

Dependencies:
common library, source code is included in this release but must be compiled first.
jackson 2.2.3 or compatible, see http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome
log4j 2, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x

For testing:
junit, see http://junit.org
hamcrest, see https://code.google.com/p/hamcrest

To compile:
First ensure all dependencies are under the lib/java and lib/java_test directories or update the relevant build.properties.

Next compile the common library using 'ant compile' from the common directory.

Finally compile Intercom using 'ant compile' from the intercom directory.

The output is located under build/jar.
The project can be tested with 'ant test'.
JavaDoc can be produced with 'ant javadoc' and will be placed into the javadoc directory.
